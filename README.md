## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
 One of the skill I aquared during the challenge is the position attribute which really played a major role in building this page.
.proud-of-this-css {
    color: #fff;
    border: 1px solid white;
    text-decoration: none;
    padding-inline: 16px;
    padding-top: 5px;
    padding-bottom: 5px;
    font-size: 16px;
    position:relative; left: 60%; top: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

During the challenge I was familiarizing myself with react.js, and I really found it interesting,
and I would really like to continue learning it and improving my skills.


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for building the entire landing page reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
